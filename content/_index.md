My name is Marko, and I spend my days helping teams wrangle data, build cool stuff in the cloud, and solve tricky problems with big data tools like Spark and Kafka. Whether it's moving millions of files, designing data systems, or just making things work better, I love turning messy data into something useful.

I've worked with startups, tech companies, and all sorts of teams - sometimes as a consultant, sometimes leading data projects, and sometimes just getting my hands dirty with code. If you're curious about my experience, skills, or want to chat about data, tech, or cats, feel free to explore or reach out!
