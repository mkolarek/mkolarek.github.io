A/B tests, or Randomized Controlled Trials, are crucial for optimizing business processes and user experience across various industries. To streamline the statistical analysis of these experiments, ExpAn (Experiment Analysis) was developed as a Python library. This library not only standardizes data structures but also paves the way for automation by being embedded into services.

### Objective

The primary goal was to formalize and encode the analysis process of A/B tests, facilitating further automation by integrating the library into broader services.

### Role 

As one of the main contributors on this project, I was responsible for:  
- Researching and implementing advanced statistical methods (specifically for estimating sample sizes).
- Open-sourcing the project on Github.
- Packaging the ExpAn library using setup.py.
- Publishing the package to PyPI.
- Automating the deployment process with TravisCI.
- Performing robust tests on multiple Python versions and environments using tox, ensuring high test coverage with coverage.

### Technology Stack  

- Language: 
  - Python  
- Libraries:
  - pandas: For structuring and analyzing data
  - scipy: For advanced statistical analysis
  - tox: For testing
  - Sphinx: For documentation
  - coverage: For measuring test coverage
