## ExpAn: Enhancing A/B Testing with Automation and Standardization

**Github link**: [https://github.com/zalando/expan](https://github.com/zalando/expan)

**Overview**: A/B tests, or Randomized Controlled Trials, are crucial for optimizing business processes and user experience across various industries. To streamline the statistical analysis of these experiments, ExpAn (Experiment Analysis) was developed as a Python library. This library not only standardizes data structures but also paves the way for automation by being embedded into services.

**Objective**: The primary goal was to formalize and encode the analysis process of A/B tests, facilitating further automation by integrating the library into broader services.

**Role**: As one of the main contributors on this project, I was responsible for:
- Open-sourcing the project on Github.
- Packaging the ExpAn library using setup.py.
- Publishing the package to PyPI.
- Automating the deployment process with TravisCI.
- Performing robust tests on multiple Python versions and environments using tox, ensuring high test coverage with coverage.

**Technology Stack**:
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **pandas**: For structuring and analyzing data
  - **scipy**: For advanced statistical analysis
  - **tox**: For testing
  - **Sphinx**: For documentation
  - **coverage**: For measuring test coverage

The combination of these technologies and processes ensured a robust, automated workflow, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of A/B test analyses.
