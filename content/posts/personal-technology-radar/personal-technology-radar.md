One kind of data visualization that I particularly like is the [technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). If you're not familiar, it's an overview of the languages, frameworks, tools, etc. used at a company at the moment (like a snapshot). What's cool about it is, that it doesn't only show a black-and-white kind of picture, where, for example, it only shows the languages a company encourages or uses. 

Rather, what's shown is a plot that's sectioned into areas such as "Adopt", "Trial", "Assess", and "Hold". Each of these areas indicates what the level of adoption of a language at the company is:
- Adopt: well-established, used in production
- Trial: ready to be used, not completely proven as Adopt
- Assess: looks interesting, but not ready for trial yet 
- Hold: we don't like these, keep away

This got me thinking, why stop at the company level? Wouldn't it be cool to showcase what my personal experience level/opinion is in a similar way?  Therefore I present to you, the [Personal Technology Radar](https://github.com/mkolarek/notebooks/blob/main/radar/radar.ipynb)!
