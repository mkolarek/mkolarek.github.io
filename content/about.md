Hi! My name is Marko and I'm a seasoned software engineer with a decade of experience under my belt, specializing in data engineering for the past nine years. Originally from Croatia, I've been based in Berlin, Germany for the last nine years, enjoying the vibrant tech scene here.

I hold an MSc in Information Processing, with a focus on computer vision, which has equipped me with a deep understanding of data and its potential. Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working across various industries, including e-commerce, property and real estate, legal, and consulting. This diverse experience has given me a broad perspective and the ability to adapt to different challenges and environments.

For the last three years, I’ve been heavily involved in architecture and infrastructure topics, honing my skills in creating robust, scalable systems. I have extensive cloud platform experience in AWS and Azure, and my go-to programming language is Python, which I’ve become proficient in through countless projects and applications.

On a personal note, I’m happily married and the proud owner of three delightful cats who keep life interesting.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to connecting and exploring how we can collaborate on exciting projects.

Best,  
Marko
