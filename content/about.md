Hi there! I'm a software engineer with ten years of experience, and for the last nine of those, I've been deep into data engineering. Originally from Croatia, I've been calling Berlin, Germany home for the past nine years.

I have a Master's degree in Information Processing, focusing on computer vision, which has given me a solid background in all things data. Over the years, I've worked in e-commerce, property and real estate, legal, and consulting, picking up lots of diverse experiences along the way.

Lately, I've been really into architecture and infrastructure, spending the last three years building strong, scalable systems. Iâ€™m pretty skilled with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, and Python is my go-to language for most projects.

On the personal side, I'm married and share my home with three awesome cats who keep things lively.

Thanks for stopping by to learn a bit about me. Looking forward to connecting and maybe working on something cool together!

Best,  
Marko
